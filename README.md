# hw1-refactor-2

# description
In this project, I was tasked with an on-the-job ticket to clean up an old webpage's code. The code on this webpage was outdated with old semantic elements, a nondescriptive title, and not compatible with screen readers. Using the skills I learned through the boot camp so far, I cleaned up the code and made it a bit more up to date with modern standards. Through this project, I learned how a language can change, adapt, and update over time depending on need and desirability.
